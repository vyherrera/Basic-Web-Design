        <h3>Social Media Marketing Mistakes</h3>
        <p>Social media marketing mistakes often arise from insufficient planning and understanding of the target audience. One common error is posting content that lacks relevance or fails to resonate with followers, which can lead to disengagement. Additionally, brands may neglect to interact with their audience, missing opportunities for building meaningful relationships and addressing customer concerns. Inconsistency in branding and messaging can also confuse potential customers, undermining trust and recognition. Over-focusing on self-promotion rather than providing valuable content can alienate followers and diminish the effectiveness of campaigns. To avoid these issues, businesses should develop a strategic plan, engage actively with their audience, and continuously analyze and adapt their approach based on performance metrics.</p>
