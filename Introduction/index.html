<h3>Social Media Marketing Mistakes</h3>
  <p>A common mistake in social media marketing is that when your audience grows some influencers tend to not respond to all of their customers' dms. Responding to dms is part of customer service. The faster you respond to dms the more satisfied your customers will be. Another common mistake is creating content that is not in your niche. For example, if your page is about skin care and you post a video about cars your followers will not go back to your page. You must create content in your niche so that your audience keeps coming back to your page.
